# Secret_Message_Decoder
This programme decrypt a 'secret message' on a collection of images<br>

## Instructions - How To Run The Program
### i. Install Python (Windows)
a. Navigate to the Python downloads page (https://www.python.org/downloads/) that indexes downloads for the most recent versions of Python.<br>
b. Download the Windows x86 MSI installer. If you're sure that your machine runs a 64-bit version of Windows, feel free to download the Windows x86-64 MSI installer instead.<br>
c. Once the download is finished, locate the file (it'll probably be in your Downloads directory) and run it. Note: the images below show Python 2.7.9, but the process is the same for newer versions.<br>
d. Follow the installation wizard. Let Python install to its default directory, C:\Python27\.<br>
e. Ensure that both "pip" is installed and that "Python" is added to your PATH.<br>
f. To confirm that your installation was successful, open IDLE, a program installed by Python that makes it easy to edit and run Python code.<br>
##### - Windows 7 (or earlier): Use the Start Menu to go to All Programs, then Python 2.7, and, finally, IDLE (Python GUI).
##### - Windows 8: Search for IDLE. Currently, you can search by swiping from the right edge of the screen or by using the lower-right corner of your screen if you have a mouse.<br>

### ii. Install Python (Mac)
a. Go to the Python downloads page that contains downloads for the most recent versions of Python.<br>
b. If you are using Mac OS X 10.6 or later, download the installer linked from that page. If you are using 10.5, you will need an alternate installer, the 32-bit i386/PPC installer.<br>
c. Open the file that you downloaded. It should either be called "python-2.7.12-macosx10.6.pkg" or "python-2.7.12-macosx10.5.pkg".<br>
d. Follow the steps in the Python Installer to successfully install Python.<br>
e. To confirm that your installation was successful, open IDLE, a program installed by Python that makes it easy to edit and run Python code.
##### - It should be in your Applications folder.
##### - You can also use Spotlight by pressing âŒ˜+Space and typing in "idle" to find it.<br>
### iii. Run The Program
a. While the IDLE is still open navigate to File>New File<br>
b. Copy the code for this program from here and paste it into the newly created file<br>
c. Save the file and Select "Run Module" from the "Run" from the top menu options<br>

### iii. Secret Message Problem
My friends and I, we play a lot of pranks on each other. Today, however, I was on the receiving end of one. This morning, I could not find my house keys. Just then, I got a text message from a friend. "We have hidden your house keys", said the text message. To find them, you have to solve a puzzle. On your computer there is a folder with several photos. If you rename all the files by removing the numbers from the photo name, the photos will reveal a secret message and lead you to the house key. This renaming of 50 files will take a long time. I can't wait to solve this puzzle so I can get my house keys.

### iv. Solution
1. Download and save the prank.zip file on your computer<br>
2. Copy the Source code of this program and paste it into the new Python IDLE file and save it<br>
3. Unzip the downloaded prank.zip file (folder) and copy the path of the unzipped file (folder)<br>
#### The unzipped file (folder) will have the photos and photo names as show below<br>

4. Change the two paths in the source code with the copied path of the unzipped file (folder)<br>
5. Save the Python file again and run the program<br>
6. Open the unzipped prank folder to see the changes done to the photos. You notice the text on the photo icons reads "KEYS ARE IN THE CLOSET. BEHIND THE SHOE BOX."<br>
Just as shown below<br>

###### You may want to sort the photos in the unzpipped prank folder by photo name for you to see similar text formation by the photos
